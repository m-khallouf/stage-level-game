- **Input Handling:** Custom input manager for handling player actions like movement and jumping.

# Project Structure

## GameManager.cs
#### Overview
The GameManager class is the core component of the game, managing the game's main logic, input, screens, and levels. It extends the Game class from the Microsoft.Xna.Framework library and acts as the central point for initializing, updating, and drawing the game components. The class handles screen resolution, input management, and controls the flow between different levels and screens (e.g., Main Menu, levels, etc.).

## InputManager.cs
#### Overview
The InputManager class is designed to manage user input through both the mouse and keyboard in a game environment. It handles events for mouse clicks on buttons (such as Play, Create, and Level Selection) and keyboard key presses (such as movement and jumping). The class is event-driven, allowing external components to subscribe to input events and handle them accordingly.
#### Features
- Mouse Input: Detects mouse clicks on specific UI buttons and triggers corresponding events.
- Keyboard Input: Handles movement and jump actions using specific keys (A/Left Arrow for left movement, D/Right Arrow for right movement, and Space for jumping).
- Event-Driven: External components can subscribe to events such as button clicks and key presses.
#### Events
- OnPlayClicked: Triggered when the Play button is clicked.
- OnCreateClicked: Triggered when the Create button is clicked.
- OnLevelOneClicked: Triggered when the Level One button is clicked.
- OnLevelTwoClicked: Triggered when the Level Two button is clicked.
- OnLevelThreeClicked: Triggered when the Level Three button is clicked.
- OnLevelFourClicked: Triggered when the Level Four button is clicked.
- OnMoveLeftClicked: Triggered when the user presses the "A" or "Left Arrow" key.
- OnMoveRightClicked: Triggered when the user presses the "D" or "Right Arrow" key.
- OnSpaceClicked: Triggered when the user presses the "Space" key.
#### Methods
- **Update(GameTime gameTime, MouseState mouseState)**
Updates the input manager by checking the keyboard state and mouse state.
- **HandleMouseInput(MouseState mouseState)**
Handles mouse input to detect button clicks and trigger corresponding events.
- **HandleKeyboardInput()**
Handles keyboard input for movement and actions (e.g., moving left, moving right, jumping) and triggers the associated events.

## ScreenManager.cs
#### Overview
The ScreenManager class is responsible for managing the different screens in the game, such as the main menu and various levels. It allows for smooth transitions between screens and centralizes the logic for updating and drawing each screen. It integrates with the InputManager to handle user inputs and change the active screen accordingly.
#### Features
- Screen Transitions: Facilitates switching between different screens like the main menu and the levels.
- Dynamic Screen Updates: Based on user input, the class updates the currently active screen (e.g., MainMenu, LevelManager, FirstLevel, etc.).
- Drawing Logic: Draws the active screen to the game window using the SpriteBatch.
- Event-Driven: Responds to user input events (e.g., button clicks) to change screens.
#### Properties
currentScreen: Holds the current screen that is being displayed. It can be any of the following: MainMenu, LevelManager, FirstLevel, SecondLevel, or ThirdLevel.
#### Event Handling
The ScreenManager subscribes to several events in the InputManager to handle user input:
- OnPlayClicked: Changes the screen to the LevelManager.
- OnLevelOneClicked: Switches the screen to the FirstLevel.
- OnLevelTwoClicked: Switches the screen to the SecondLevel.
- OnLevelThreeClicked: Switches the screen to the ThirdLevel.

## LevelManager.cs
#### Overview
The LevelManager class is responsible for managing the levels in the game, particularly by displaying level selection buttons and handling user input to select levels. It renders the level buttons and associated labels on the screen, allowing the player to choose a level to play.
#### Features
- Level Button Display: Draws buttons on the screen for each available level (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4).
- User Input Handling: Tracks mouse input to detect which level button the player clicks, allowing them to choose a level.
- Level Button Coordinates: Each level button is positioned on the screen using defined coordinates for better control over the layout.
